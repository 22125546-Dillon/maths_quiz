# maths_quiz

This Flutter application is designed to assist kids with maths drills. It generates a set of 10 arithmetic problems randomly, covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations within specified number ranges. Users can input their answers for each problem, and the app provides immediate feedback on correctness. At the end of the drill, a score out of 10 is calculated to evaluate the child's performance.
